My 3rd project:
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a fascinating
zero-player game that operates based on simple rules but exhibits complex and interesting behavior. The game consists
of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead.

The game evolves through iterations or generations. At each generation, the state of each cell is determined by its neighboring 
cells. The rules are as follows:
  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
  
  
These simple rules give rise to fascinating patterns and behaviors. The game can exhibit stable patterns,
periodic oscillations, or even create intricate structures known as "gliders" that move across the grid. It
has captured the interest of mathematicians, computer scientists, and enthusiasts due to its rich and unpredictable nature.

Conway's Game of Life is not a conventional game in the sense of competition or strategy, but rather a simulation
that demonstrates emergent behavior and the complexity that can arise from simple rules. It serves as a captivating example 
of how complexity can arise from the interaction of simple elements.
